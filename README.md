Once installed, you should see a new icon appearing on the top left corner of your browser.
The icon is grey because the extension is not active

Now, if you go to Odissey website, the icon should appear colored, which means the extension properly works. You have nothing more to do, the extension is now listening on Odissey. Relax and enjoy !
